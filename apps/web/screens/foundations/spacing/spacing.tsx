        To ensure consistent alignment across elements, we use a spacing scale based on <Code>8px</Code> and{" "}
        <Code>4px</Code> units. These values are easily multiplied, offering flexible and consistent spacing steps that
        are distinct enough to accommodate a variety of layouts.

          <strong>Margins</strong> and <strong>padding</strong> are key to separating elements and creating visual
          breathing room. They manage the negative space between UI components, enhancing clarity and structure.

        <BulletedList>
          <li>
            <strong>Margin:</strong> The space outside an element. It creates a gap between the element and other
            surrounding elements, ensuring that components aren't too crowded.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Padding:</strong> The space inside an element. It creates a buffer between the element's content
            (like text or images) and its borders, providing more clarity and breathing room for the content.
          </li>
        </BulletedList>
        <Paragraph>
          To establish a clear visual hierarchy, apply different spacing values according to the relative importance of
          elements.

        across components and layouts. These tokens are named based on the <Code>space</Code> prefix followed by the
        value in <Code>px</Code> units.

        </Paragraph>
        <BulletedList>
          <li>
            <strong>Enhanced User Experience and Readability:</strong> Proper spacing makes content easier to read and
            interact with, reducing eye strain and improving user engagement.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Consistency:</strong> A standardized spacing system ensures visual cohesion across different
            elements and screens.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Visual Hierarchy:</strong> Spacing helps establish a clear hierarchy by guiding users' attention to
            key elements.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Increased Engagement:</strong> Clean, well-spaced designs are more inviting, leading to increased
            interaction and user satisfaction.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Reduced Clutter:</strong> Proper spacing prevents elements from feeling crowded, making the design
            more professional and focused.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Efficiency:</strong> Once established, a consistent spacing system saves time by streamlining future
            projects.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Improved Developer Collaboration:</strong> Clear spacing guidelines make implementation smoother and
            reduce potential miscommunication during development.
